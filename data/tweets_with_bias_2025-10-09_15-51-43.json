    "text": "Why market dumping in PUMPTOBER ?\n\nThis is happening to liquidate all the bulls and mainly the retail because MMs always flush longs before sending the market. I think pump will start again from 15th-20th and oct will end with a massive pump. \n\nThey want you to be bearish and believe that PUMPTOBER is canceled. However, when the market is in complete fear, we will see a massive bounce and the parabolic Q4 pump will start end of October. \n\nOctober monthly will close with high % gains and kickstart the parabolic banana rally which will send \n\nBitcoin - $150k to $180k, \nETH - $8,000 to $12,000,\n\nFinally the REAL Altseason will start and we will see altcoins pumping 10x to 50x in just 3 to 4 months. \n\nWe need to have a Little more patience. \n\nI know it‚Äôs exhausting but I promise you it will be 100% worth it. Cartels played same games before the 2017 and 2021 Mega pump. \n\nlike and repost if I should post more short term predictions like this.",

    "text": "Cantor Fitzgerald Raises $NVDA PT to $300 from $240 - OW; NEW STREET HIGH\n\nAnalyst comments: \"We hosted NVIDIA management for investor meetings in NYC this past week, including Jensen Huang (CEO), Colette Kress (CFO), Toshiya Hari (IR), and other senior executives. At a high level, a lot has changed from a year ago, with things moving at exponential speed. As one would expect, Jensen was quite bullish‚Äîand with great reason, in our view. We are still in the early innings of a multi-trillion AI infrastructure build-out, with Hyperscalers alone providing significant line-of-sight into hundreds of billions of demand over the next several years, not to mention other drivers such as Neo-Clouds, Enterprise, and Physical AI. Thus, this is not a bubble, and we are still early in the investment cycle.\n\nA particular spotlight during this trip was the company‚Äôs new partnership with OpenAI, where they aim to stand it up as its own self-hosted hyperscaler. The vision is to remove margin stacking by server ODMs and CSPs, narrowing the cost delta between NVDA and ASICs to only around 15%‚Äîa win-win for both and a potential source of further pressure on the ASIC market. NVIDIA continues to work at Extreme Co-Design on an annual cadence, optimizing the entire AI infrastructure through a full-stack solution including CUDA-X.\n\nPut simply, Jensen and the team are as focused and competitive as ever, and they are playing to win. We do not see a scenario where NVDA fails to secure at least 75% of the AI accelerator market over time. Following three days of meetings, our confidence in both the growth of AI infrastructure and NVIDIA‚Äôs market share through the 2030 timeframe has increased considerably.\n\nWe continue to see $8 in EPS as very doable into CY26 (consensus $6.26), followed by $11 in CY27 (consensus $7.36). Considering a backdrop where out-year consensus may still be 50% too low, NVDA remains our Top Pick and offers the most upside. We are raising our price target to $300 (27x expected $11 in CY26) from $240 (30x expected $8 in CY26), suggesting near-term upside of 60%+, with further upside potential as the company drives toward its stretch goal of $50 in EPS into CY30 within a $3‚Äì4 trillion AI infrastructure world. In the words of the Boss... Baby, NVDA was (and continues to be) Born to Run.\"\n\nAnalyst: C.J. Muse",
