The backlog quality suddenly looked less secured\nMany investors treated the OpenAI relationship like a typical binding hyperscaler contract but Broadcom’s “multiyear journey” language in the Q&A made it sound more like a general framework than a firm capacity commitment.\n\n2. The revenue timing moved far out\nManagement made it clear that meaningful XPU revenue does not show up in 2026 & instead ramps in 2027–2029 and long-dated revenue always carries higher risk so this needs to be discounted.\n\n3. Supply constraints cap 2026 upside\nBroadcom disclosed a $72B backlog with 18-month lead times which signals they're already running at full capacity & cannot accelerate deliveries even if demand spikes so that limits how much they can monetize the hottest phase of hyperscaler AI spend.",
