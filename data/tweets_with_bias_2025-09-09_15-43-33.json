The scale of the agreement and associated financing flexibility should enable Nebius to accelerate capacity expansion beyond the company's own prior expectations, in our view. We believe that the cash flows from this deal could help with the required buildout, while also assuming some prepayment and Nebius' ability to finance rest of the Microsoft buildout with debt. We note that the company highlighted that the economics of the deal are attractive in their own right, implying good GMs, while the deal will also help Nebius to accelerate the growth of their AI cloud business even further in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nAnalyst: Alexander Duval",
