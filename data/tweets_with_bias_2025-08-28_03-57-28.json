I then programmed these principles into computers as decision rules to bet on them working.  Because the causes come before the effects, this principles-based approach worked amazingly well for me.\n\nSince I’m 76, I’m now at a stage in my life that I want to pass along what’s of value. So far, I’ve passed along my perspectives and principles about how to approach life, work, the changing world order, debt, and markets in my books, videos, and social media.  But I think that what is most important is that you have your own good principles and perspectives that suit you, and I believe in thoughtful disagreement to find out what’s best, so I love to have exchanges about how the world works with you and others.\n\nIf you want to ask me anything, you don’t have to wait for the AMA to begin. We’re going to collect questions from my social media pages so I can answer as many as possible when the time comes.\n\nSo please ask your questions in the comments below.",

    "text": "BREAKING: We exposed how George Soros converts tax-deductible donations into political campaigns through a $34 million pipeline where Tides and Working Families Party coordinate to support candidates like Zohran Mamdani\n\nOur investigation uncovered a $2+ billion tax-exempt network that systematically converted charitable donations into political power. The numbers tell the story.\n\nFULL INVESTIGATION: [link]: ➡️whitecollarfraud.com/2025/08…\n\nTHE BASIC SCHEME: George Soros donates to his Foundation to Promote Open Society (501c3) - tax deductible → $8.4M flows to Tides Foundation (501c3) → $29.3M flows to Tides Advocacy (501c4) for \"political advocacy\" → Coordinates with Working Families Organization supporting candidates like Mamdani\n\nTHE SMOKING GUN - REVERSE FLOWS: After receiving $9.71M from the Soros pipeline, Working Families Organization sent $325,000 BACK to Tides entities. Independent charities don't do this. It's mathematical proof of coordination. \n\nSYSTEMATIC CONCEALMENT: Tides Advocacy (501c4) lists Janiece Evans-Page as Director, while she simultaneously serves as CEO of both Tides Foundation (501c3) and Tides Center (501c3), yet Tides Advocacy filed NO disclosure forms for 5+ years while receiving $29.3M. \n\nTHE EIN SCANDALS: \n➡️Working Families Organization reported $80,000 to \"WFP National PAC\" but used an EIN that actually belongs to \"International Earthlight Alliance.\"\n➡️Tides Center reported a $343,753 contribution to \"Tides Advocacy\" using an EIN that belongs to \"Think Outside Da Block Inc.\n\nPROFESSIONAL AUDITOR CONFIRMATION: Deloitte auditors confirmed operational integration between Tides Foundation and Tides Center, requiring consolidated financial statements. Yet Tides Advocacy - sharing the same leadership - systematically concealed these relationships. 6/\n\nTHE SCALE:\n➡️$34.4M in documented flows between supposedly independent entities\n➡️$16.1M in government grants flowing to organizations with political arms\n➡️$36.5M in admitted \"political transfers\" by Open Society Institute\n➡️Over $2B in total network operations\n\nOUR EVIDENCE: Every dollar amount traced to original IRS Form 990 filings. We've filed a Fifth Supplemental IRS whistleblower complaint documenting potential $500M+ in tax recovery from this coordination system.\n\nTHE MAMDANI CONNECTION: This network manufactured his \"grassroots\" campaign while maintaining the illusion of independent charitable work. The infrastructure that created his political rise operates continuously, creating candidates nationwide. \n\nWHY IT MATTERS: If charitable tax deductions can be systematically converted into political coordination through concealed control structures, it undermines the entire tax-exempt system. Donors get tax breaks, candidates get \"grassroots\" cover, taxpayers subsidize political operations.\n\nThe mathematics don't lie. When organizations engage in $34M+ flows while concealing key relationships and sending money backward through the system, these patterns warrant investigation.",
