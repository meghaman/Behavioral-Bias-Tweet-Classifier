    "text": "The riskiest stocks continue to outperform.\n\nThese charts compare the performance of S&P 500 High Beta stocks ($SPHBI) versus Low Volatility stocks ($SPLVI) from 1995-2020 and 2006-2025, along with their relative performance ratio and momentum indicators.\n\nSince 1995, Low Volatility stocks dramatically outperformed, growing approximately 14x versus the High Beta's 4x growth over the period to 2020.\n\nSince the 2020 low, High Beta has dramatically outperformed Low Volatility, in two notable periods circled in orange:\n\n1. 2020-2021\n2. 2024-today (late 2025)\n\n1. The Low Volatility Anomaly\nThe second chart demonstrates a counterintuitive market phenomenon - lower risk stocks actually delivered higher returns, contradicting traditional finance theory that higher risk should equal higher reward.\n2. Drawdown Differences\nDuring market crashes (2000-2002, 2008-2009, 2020), the High Beta Index suffered severe losses while the Low Volatility Index showed much smaller declines, preserving capital better.\n3. Compounding Advantage\nThe Low Volatility Index's smaller drawdowns meant less ground to recover, allowing returns to compound more effectively over time - a mathematical advantage that becomes increasingly powerful over long periods.\n\nStrategy Implications\n\n* Risk management matters more than return chasing\n* \"Slow and steady\" outperformed \"high risk/high reward\"\n* Avoiding large losses may be more important than capturing large gains",
