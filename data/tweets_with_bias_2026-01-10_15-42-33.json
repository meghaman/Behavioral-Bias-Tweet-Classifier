    "text": "5 Steps to Turn Your Trading Around\n\nThe beauty of trading is that every day offers a fresh start. But if you want to improve, you need a reality check. You can’t keep doing what you’ve been doing. \n\nYou must set your ego aside, assess your performance, and take real action to change. Here are five steps to taking a hard look in the mirror and getting better.\n\n1. Analyze Your Past Year\nStart by reviewing your last 12 months of trading data. Log your P&L for each trade, plus your performance by month, week, and day, into a spreadsheet. This shows how well you’re really doing. A basic P&L number isn’t enough.\n\n2. Identify the Patterns Behind Your P&L\n\nDive into the numbers to spot trends. Are you holding losing trades too long? Selling winners too early? Struggling with shorting? Are there specific stocks or sectors where you perform poorly? Are you losing big on options? Asking questions like these reveals the true drivers of your P&L. If you need help, use an AI tool or hire a statistics expert.\n\n3. Break a Single Bad Habit... and Then Another\n\nYour #1 goal should be to eliminate habits that cost you money. It’s far easier to cut $100,000 in losses from bad decisions than to earn $100,000 in profits. If you lose money on Fed days, stop trading them. If shorting leads to losses, stop shorting. Break one bad habit, then another, and another. Only add new tools to your arsenal once you’ve discarded the bad ones.\n\n4. Build a Daily Routine\n\nSuccessful traders don’t wing it—they follow a routine they enjoy. If you don’t enjoy your routine, you’ll never stick to it. Create a checklist of morning tasks, like reading news, scanning charts, and tracking futures. Systemize these to stay focused and avoid distractions like TV or social media. A consistent routine keeps you productive and grounded.\n\n5. Look at Your Life\n\nTrading is intense, so you need to step away to recharge. Pick up a hobby or sport—running, chess, or even video games—that demands your full attention. Prioritize your health: eat well, sleep well, and exercise. A healthy mind that makes good decision starts with a healthy body. If you have personal problems, address them. Family or work issues that weigh on your mind will hurt your trading performance. Face them head-on. This never gets discussed in trading circles - but it’s more important than you can imagine.\n\nIf you want more insights from me, make sure you check out my 2x/week trading newsletter:\n\nt3live.com/scott-free-newsle…",
