The stock bounced and pushed toward the 8-day moving average. It wasn’t a massive breakout, but it was a tradable move.\n\nThe key lesson: if you caught the reversal, you trim into strength near the 8-day. Then you look for an inside range setup to potentially extend gains.\n\n2. $NVDA\nNvidia remains stuck in an annoying range. Now it’s sitting around $187. If it holds $186.76 and tightens up, you could buy weakness for a “red-to-green” move.\n\nAgain, this is range trading — not trend trading.\n\n3. $SNDK\nSanDisk offered a massive intraday opportunity yesterday — down 15 to up 15. It’s now above the 8/21-day moving averages, showing relative strength.\n\nThe sharp pullback was a gift if traded properly. It remains one of the stronger names (“best in breed”) and could continue sideways before another push.\n\n4. $MU / $WDC\nMicron held $392, respected the wedge pattern, and pushed higher. Western Digital is also firm.\n\nTreat these memory stocks as a group — if they’re acting well together, that’s constructive.\n\n5. $AAPL\n$262 is an area to watch, but it’s still range-bound.\n\n*\nThis market is largely range-bound. Very few stocks are making decisive higher highs. \n\nKey takeaway: do the tactical cash-flow trading now.",

It is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV.\n(3) ROC or Return of Capital indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates based on the latest 19a1 forms and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nEx Date: The first day a stock without the right to receive the upcoming distribution\nPayment Date: Date on which the distribution is paid to eligible shareholders.",
