Combined with Amazon’s recent earnings report, we view the key takeaways from re:Invent and management’s forward narrative as another positive step in improving investor sentiment around AWS’s artificial intelligence thematic positioning.\n\nWe see these two events—earnings and re:Invent—as supportive of (a) Amazon’s ability to re-accelerate revenue growth and (b) the role AWS will play as the artificial intelligence theme expands from a small set of foundational models to broader deployment (agents), development (applications), and workload migration (requiring lower costs and greater efficiencies) for enterprise customers. In many ways, AWS’s framing of the artificial intelligence opportunity reflects hallmarks of its e-commerce success: breadth of supply, ease of purchase and partnership, matching demand and supply at scale, and a singular customer-focused platform mindset.\n\nManagement’s presentations imply that AWS’s strategic priority is to position the company to capitalize on the rise—and eventual ubiquity—of artificial intelligence, similar to how prior shifts in compute, storage, and databases shaped earlier phases of cloud industry growth. We also refresh our recent fundamental work on the current cloud landscape and AWS’s forward growth opportunity. We remain confident in our view that AWS can achieve roughly a 20%+ revenue compound annual growth rate over the next three years.\"\n\nAnalyst: Eric Sheridan",
