    "text": "THE 3 FIXES $HIMS NEEDS RIGHT NOW\n\n1. Fix the top of the funnel so new customers start growing again  \n\nHims built its whole business on being able to bring in huge numbers of new customers cheaply and easily. That stopped working when marketing got more expensive and net new subscribers slowed. Even though Hims has more than 2.5M subscribers today, the engine isn't adding people fast enough unless the company leans harder on raising ARPU.\n\nI also don’t buy the idea that this is ONLY a Sexual Health issue shifting from episodic to subscription SKUs. The broader truth is that digital ads are more expensive, more crowded and harder to win now that companies like $AMZN & $GOOGL are competing for the same customers.\n\nThe fastest way to reset sentiment is to stabilize CAC, and Hims can do that by publishing more transparent funnel metrics and shifting ~25% of marketing spend into high-intent, low-CAC channels that actually scale. Even one or two quarters where CAC flattens would flip the narrative because it proves the engine can still scale efficiently.\n\n2. Make Diagnostics the default onboarding path\n\nDiagnostics can change the business because it gives Hims a way to guide every new user into the correct treatment path instead of hoping they arrive through a single-category entry point like hair loss or sexual health. If diagnostics becomes the front door then someone might come in for one issue but stay for multiple conditions over time.\n\nThat increases retention, raises lifetime value and stabilizes revenue. For this to work Hims needs to route all new users into a single diagnostic intake, build a recommendation engine that automatically matches users to the right care categories and follow up with personalized plans that raise ARPU naturally instead of relying on blunt upsells.\n\n3. How Palantir’s ontology would help Hims fix acquisition\n\nHims has one of the richest data sets in consumer healthcare. They already know how different conditions convert, how long users stay on treatments, what causes churn, when people switch categories and what long-term health journeys look like. The problem is that this data lives in separate systems and teams, which means they see pieces of the puzzle but not the whole picture.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of problem $PLTR ontology is built to solve and if I were @AndrewDudum this would be one of my highest-priority initiatives. \n\nPalantir’s ontology acts like an organizational brain that connects data from every corner of the company and shows how everything fits together in real time. It would let Hims see the entire customer journey as one unified system from the moment someone clicks a TikTok ad, to their first prescription, to refill behavior, to switching into new categories and long-term retention.\n\nRight now Hims sees each part of the customer journey in isolation but Palantir would let them stitch it into one living system that updates in real time and actually explains why cohorts behave the way they do.",

    "text": "This chart is exactly why I think the AI bubble is still years away.\n\nWhen peak power needed breaks away from peak power available around 2028 it makes clear that the real limit on AI is no longer how many GPUs $NVDA can ship but how much energy the grid can actually deliver to run them.\n\nOnce that gap opens the entire ecosystem gets pushed into a digestion phase. Not because AI adoption slows but because the grid becomes the binding constraint which is when the S-curve behavior shows up.\n\nAI bears will point to that period and call it the bursting of the AI bubble but it’s really just the moment where the physical economy has to catch up to the digital one.",
