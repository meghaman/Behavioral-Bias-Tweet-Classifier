This convergence reflects indecision, as price trades just below the shorter-term averages, which may act as near-term resistance.\n\nFrom a bullish perspective, a decisive move back above this cluster of moving averages would signal potential for upward momentum and a retest of higher resistance levels.\n\nFrom a bearish perspective, failure to reclaim these averages could leave XRP vulnerable to renewed selling pressure, reinforcing the current consolidative structure and opening the door for further downside within the range.",

The combination of the speed of the move, and the economic uncertainty it creates due to the catalyst, it’s likely to negatively impact general eco demand, in contrast to a slow and steady move higher in oil from a better economic outlook, which is more inflationary over time.

    "text": "If you don’t love your life, it's because someone else influenced it more than you did. Don’t let that happen.  You deserve to have success and passion in your life—a big goal worth committing yourself to. You deserve to engage in a life that sparks your interest and challenges you intellectually. Your reality isn’t waiting to be discovered, it’s waiting to be created. \nMost people procrastinate. They wait for the perfect moment, the perfect plan, the perfect feeling of certainty. But here’s the truth: the perfect moment never comes. What comes is the moment you decide to stop waiting. That’s when everything begins to shift. It’s not luck. It’s not fate. It’s not waiting for motivation to strike. It’s a decision, plain and simple. A bold, non-negotiable decision that says, \"No more excuses. I’m in control. Today I'm deciding to decide.\" \nJust as a smoker can become an ex-smoker by putting out the last cigarette or an alcoholic can put down a drink and never touch a drop again, so it is with limiting beliefs and behaviors. Change happens in an instant. You can decide to be the owner of your world—or a victim of your circumstances. You can flip the switch and activate your dreams, starting today. But first you have to decide to decide.\nThe choice is in your hands. What will you decide? \nWill you keep going with the status quo? Will you let your past create the same kind of future? Will you allow chance to make the decisions for you about the amount and quality of health, wealth, and happiness you experience?\nYou will never know what your true potential really is until you make the decision to believe in your own ability and take action. Learn from your victories, from your mistakes, and from the past. Embrace failure as a valuable part of the learning process. Then commit to an unconditional march in the directions of your dreams. You will amaze yourself! 🙏",
