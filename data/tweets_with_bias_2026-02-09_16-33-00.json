So, what's next?\n\n– $GOOGL had strong earnings but was sold into. The key level to watch now is ~$319—holding it keeps the trade viable, losing it opens downside and likely signals weak follow-through across all mega caps.\n\n– $AMZN is a potential gap-fill trade toward ~$214, but failure to fill that gap would invalidate valuation arguments (Amazon is at its lowest valuation ever) and suggest staying away.\n\n– $MSFT is a broken bounce with resistance near $408–$420 after a rejected gap down.\n\n– $NVDA remains range-bound; ~$182 is the critical support—holding it could stabilize price, losing it would be disappointing and difficult to trade.\n\n– $TSLA offered a trade off the 200-day moving average into the 8-day, and now must prove it can hold higher and reclaim resistance.\n\n– $AAPL has been the best recent performer for me. It is now above key moving averages and may work toward $300, though it looks somewhat extended. I am keeping an eye on $AAPL.\n\nSo, frame trades tightly around clear levels. If leaders can’t turn green and hold support, upside in mega-cap tech is still limited.",
