This is classic range trading, where false breakdowns and failed breakouts dominate.\n\n$QQQ led to the downside recently, but this weakness appears engineered rather than organic.\n\n$IWM continues to hold key levels, reinforcing the idea that the market is being actively managed within a range rather than breaking down.\n\nDespite the difficulty, there are still opportunities, but traders have to work much harder to find them. This is not a market where broad exposure works easily; it rewards focused, name-by-name execution.\n\nFor me, $AAPL stands out as a stock that has improved meaningfully since earnings. $267 is a key level—if Apple can hold above it, the stock can maintain a constructive, buy-the-dip type sequence where positions can be managed on the long side.\n\n$AMZN is still an earnings play despite a recent down day.
