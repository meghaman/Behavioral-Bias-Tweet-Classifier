Memory (HBM): AI is becoming memory-first as models & agents think longer & retain more context. Every new generation requires more HBM per GPU which increases dollars per chip & makes $MU one of the most under-appreciated leverage points in the stack.\n\n3. Power: The emerging bottleneck because efficiency improves ~2x per generation but compute demand scales ~4–5x so the gap is widening.\n\nIt used to be about who could deliver the most compute per dollar but now it’s about who can deliver the most compute per watt.",
