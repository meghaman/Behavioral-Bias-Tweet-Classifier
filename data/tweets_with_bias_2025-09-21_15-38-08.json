A guest appearance on one of the top business podcasts in the world. Launching something as disruptive as @FuturumEquities and getting approval to become a sell-side shop.\n\nTwo years ago I started this account to transparently show how I could turn $100K into $1M. That was the experiment. I didn‚Äôt expect 55M monthly impressions. I didn‚Äôt expect to be on TV weekly, breaking down ideas in front of a national audience. I didn‚Äôt expect a platform or an audience of this scale. What I did expect -- and what I bet on -- was that hard work compounds. Stay disciplined, stay locked in, and the path reveals itself.\n\nSo when my growth portfolio crossed $1M this past week -- it was the moment that reminded me how far I‚Äôve come. From being early on names like $PLTR under $10, $RKLB under $4, $IONQ under $8, $CRWD under $100, and $ALAB under $50 -- all of which the market now chases after their 5x moves -- to seeing the early signs of what I believe are the next big reratings I‚Äôve called out with $EOSE, $TEM, $JMIA $DOCN, and $NVTS, it‚Äôs been about conviction before consensus. \n\nTo hit that goal within ten days of my wedding made it even more meaningful -- proof that the personal and professional chapters of my life are compounding together. \n\nIt felt like reaching the top of a hill after grinding every single day and realizing the view is even bigger than I imagined.
