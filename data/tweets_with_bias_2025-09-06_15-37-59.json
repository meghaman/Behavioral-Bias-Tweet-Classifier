No more trade-off between liquidity and returns; you get both.\n\n➡️  Backed by real assets: \n\nThink tokenized Treasuries and money market funds like Franklin Templeton’s BENJI and Ondo’s USDY. TradFi isn’t just dipping its toes anymore; it’s fully on-chain.\n\n➡️  Unlocking RWA Liquidity\n\n$STBL turns tokenized treasuries & RWAs into USST stablecoin + YLD yield. TradFi assets now flow into DeFi, liquidity and returns, no compromise.\n\n➡️ TGE COMING SOON while momentum is Building Fast\n\nAlready secured a $500M institutional minting commitments.\n\nDisclaimer - we have a partnership with STBL so please don’t forget to do your own research.",
