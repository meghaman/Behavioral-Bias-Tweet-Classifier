    "text": "MY 3 BIGGEST TAKEAWAYS FROM $GOOGL EARNINGS\n\n1. Search is not breaking under AI but bending in a favorable way\nThe most underappreciated data point in the quarter was Search grew 17% YoY (fastest pace since early 2022) at the same time Gemini usage + AI Overviews are scaling. That tells you AI is not shrinking the search business but reshaping demand in a way that improves query quality & ad relevance instead of cannibalizing it.\n\n2. Google Cloud is on fire\nCloud grew 48% on a $70B+ run-rate business with operating income more than doubling & margins near 30% while the backlog is jumping to $240B (+55% QoQ) shows AI workloads are pulling forward multi-year demand. The growth is coming from Google selling a full stack from chips to models to platforms to agents which creates multiple revenue layers as usage scales.\n\n3. Google capex number is a neon sign that demand is outrunning current supply\nThe stock faded because the market is focused on supply constraints & near-term margin pressure. Google is building out data centers & buying massive amounts of compute while management said capacity across chips & power remains tight. The 2026 capex guide blew past expectations which adds uncertainty around timing but the bigger signal is that demand for AI is strong enough to justify this level of spend. About half of next year’s AI compute is going toward Cloud customers meaning a large portion of this investment is aimed at external, revenue-generating demand.",

    "text": "Totally agree that the pricing-power-erosion angle is the real gut punch here, even if demand doesn't evaporate overnight.\n\nI've been thinking about this sell-off, and it reminds me a lot of what happened with Disney/ESPN back in August 2015. Bob Iger basically admitted on the earnings call that ESPN was seeing \"some modest subscriber losses\" due to cord-cutting trends. It wasn't apocalyptic—he called ESPN a \"must-have\" and said they were bullish on the bundle—but the market had this sudden epiphany: cable TV's subscriber base was in terminal decline, and it wasn't reversing. Stocks tanked hard (Disney dropped ~9% the next day), and yeah, the concern proved very real.\n\nFast-forward 10+ years: look at the chart you know well—DIS is basically back to where it was in mid-2015, hovering around $100–110 lately (closed ~$107 this week). The big run-up to ~$200 in 2021 was legit streaming/Disney+ growth + post-COVID recovery, but it didn't stick once the cable pressures kept grinding away. ESPN has been in this slow bleed ever since.\n\nI feel like something similar is playing out now with SaaS/software. Markets are having an \"aha\" moment that agentic AI is real, it's here, and it's going to force a total rethink of how these businesses work—pricing, moats, everything. Not tomorrow or next quarter, but the business models are going to have to evolve or get disrupted hard. The sell-off wiped out hundreds of billions (reports peg ~$300B from key software indices alone in this \"SaaSpocalypse\"), and while some stocks look oversold short-term, the underlying fear isn't just noise.\n\nDon't think it's nothing—it's probably a real shift in how the market views these companies' long-term futures.
