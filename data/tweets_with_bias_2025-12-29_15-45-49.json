The Great Depression (1929-1933) was preceded by late-1920s commodity spikes amid broader speculation.\n\nWhere not true: Japan's 1990s deflation followed a real estate/stock bubble, without major commodity mania. The brief 2008 deflation stemmed from a housing crisis, not pure commodity surges.\n\nIn reality, manias can trigger busts via debt or oversupply, but not all deflations start this way—some arise from demand shocks or policy errors.
