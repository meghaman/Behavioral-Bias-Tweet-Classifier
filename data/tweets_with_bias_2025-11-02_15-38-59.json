Its renewable energy costs average ~3.5 cents per kWh (among the lowest in North America) and it owns the physical land, substations & cooling systems needed to bring additional capacity online quickly.\n\nWhat differentiates IREN is its ability to convert that cheap power into rentable GPU capacity faster than most peers. The company already operates its own AI cloud with several thousand active $NVDA GPUs and expansion plans call for tens of thousands more across Canada & Texas. These facilities can be commissioned within quarters because permitting, power interconnection & infrastructure groundwork are already in place.\n\nThe internal economics is what attractive me to it since IREN owns both the energy and the shells, which causes no pass-through charges & gross margins on GPU compute can exceed 70%. Management has hinted at a roadmap to 60K GPUs by 2026 & ~$2.5B in cloud service provider rev once utilization ramps.\n\nWhen you own the power, the land & the hardware like IREN does then you capture the full margin instead of splitting it across vendors.",

The real constraint is not compute but power & data center space.\n\nThis is exactly why access to powered data centers has become the new leverage point.\n\nIf compute is easy to buy but power is hard to get, the leverage moves to whoever controls energy & infrastructure. Every new data center that $MSFT, $GOOGL, $AMZN, $META & $ORCL are trying to build needs hundreds of megawatts of steady power. Getting that energy online now takes years which means the players who locked in power early & built vertically across the stack are the ones with real control.\n\nHyperscaler growth is no longer defined by how many GPUs they can buy but by how quickly they can energize new capacity.\n\nSatya’s other point about not wanting to overbuy one generation of GPUs matters just as much. The refresh cycle is shortening as Nvidia releases faster chips every year which means the useful life of a GPU now depends on how quickly it can be deployed into production. When power & space are delayed then that GPU loses value before it ever produces a dollar of compute revenue.\n\nSatya just validated why my DCA plan remains overweight in the AI Utility theme. The AI economy will scale at the rate power comes online, not at the rate chips improve. The next phase of AI infrastructure growth will belong to whoever can energize capacity faster than demand expands.\n\nPower has become the pricing layer of intelligence: $IREN, $CIFR, $NBIS, $APLD, $WULF, $EOSE, $CRWV",
