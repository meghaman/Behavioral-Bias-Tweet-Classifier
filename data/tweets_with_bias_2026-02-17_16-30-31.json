So right now, investors are stepping back from the entire AI complex and justifying that caution with whichever negative narrative feels most emotionally convincing in the moment.\n\nThat behavior is understandable during periods of uncertainty but it also creates MASSIVE opportunity in companies with real moats in the new economy being built in real time, especially when stocks are being priced as if multiple worst-case outcomes are all going to happen at the same time.",
