Davos 2026 quietly confirmed a regime shift\nThe conversations weren’t about AI potential anymore but were about power constraints, deployment timelines & who actually controls bottlenecks. \n\n2. Why I added a new software position during SaaSpocalypse 2026\nIn an agentic world, the agent becomes the worker but the system of record becomes the manager and this software name fits that profile. \n\n3. The new bar for software in the AI economy\nThe winners won’t be the tools people use but the systems they can’t operate without which means ownership of data flow, control over outcomes & tight integration with hardware, infrastructure or regulated environments. If a software company doesn’t sit on a control point then margins will compress.\n\n4. A special announcement we’ve been building toward for six months\nAn exciting way to be able to participate in the builders of tomorrow for the investors of today.",
