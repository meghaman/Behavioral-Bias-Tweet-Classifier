And last quarter, over $100M of that went straight to $COIN.\n\nMore than 22% of USDC sits on Coinbase, and Circle pays them a cut of reserve income for it -- nearly 40% of total opex. That cut grows with adoption. As USDC scales, so do Coinbase’s profits -- without the infrastructure risk or regulatory load.\n\nSo if Circle’s worth $50B for powering digital dollars… why is Coinbase -- the gatekeeper collecting a fee on every token minted and held -- only worth $75B?\n\nCircle may be building the rails.\nBut Coinbase owns the flow.",

See if it pops back up, which it's done a bunch of times in this sequence.\n\n$QQQ and tech are holding up better, which is important. As long as it holds the 527ish area, it's hard to get too bearish. Just need to be in the right names.\n\nWe caught a nice $IWM move into the $215 area, which we managed well. Early this week, some bought back on the Red Dog Reversal Monday at the $208 pivot.\nMegacap tech is very stock-specific.\n\n$MSFT grinded to an all-time high but has no setup. Had to just buy the 8-day.\n\n$NFLX is trending over 8/21-day. But can't really trade it through levels.\n\n$AMZN choppy but constructive if it holds the $209-$210 area. Resistance is closer to $218.\n\n$META is one of the stronger names and needs to hold $690. A move above $708 brings momentum here.\n\n$TSLA is building an inside wedge. It's very tricky at time but held support Wednesday. To get momentum, it has to get over $335 with volume.\n\nSemis/AI names are specific and a leading tell for tech.\n\n$CRWV got to the top of the go-to list since its IPO. Congrats if you caught the moves we outlined. It seems headed to $200, but be careful with sizing.\n\n$NVDA seems ready to go to the $150 area but is taking its time. It's beeen better to be long vs. the $142 area instead of adding on strength. Getting over $146.15 can drive the rally.\n\n$SMCI's chart got tight, so I bought options and stock early in the week plus the stock. It needs to clear $46.50 with big volume for a major momentum move.\n\nQuantum names gave levels earlier in the week to trade against.\n\n$IONQ needs to hold $36.03.\n$QBTS needs to hold $14.84.\n$QUBT needs to hold $16.45.\n\nAs long as these levels hold, buyers will step up.\n\n$DASH is a VTF® favorite and looks good. It held 215; 230+ can happen in a better market.\n\n$PLTR is a focus. We've been navigating it for months. Held where it had to as it makes new highs every few days to manage.\n\nOn Wednesday, I outlined a way to get long $CRCL. Some were long vs. the $145.88 gap pivot. Others bought when it got and stayed above $165.60. Now it's over $220+ to trim.\n\nWe focused on $COIN again. It had a nice channel that triggered Wednesday. Today's a day to trim and trail as it's up $6.\n\nBitcoin held the 50-day again. I got long $IBIT into support. It's up nicely this morning to trim, but it has more room higher.",
