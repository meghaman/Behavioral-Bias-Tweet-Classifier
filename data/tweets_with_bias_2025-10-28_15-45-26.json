On levered ETFs ... the question isn't JUST size, it's that their rebalancing is mechanical and \"model-able\" (is that a word?). That matters when they're ... for example...15-20% of daily volume in high-beta stocks..\n\nI listed to a good podcast a while ago on Flirting with Models... here is a quote from it talking about the importance of understanding flows... give it a listen...\n\n\"But then things which you would look at in mid frequency, which you wouldn't look at so much in low frequency, is anything to do with microstructure. So what does the order book look like? What does the short term trade flow look like? And, yeah, these are all things where you would care a lot about them for high frequency trading as well. I think the difference is probably that in high frequency you care about the individual events a lot more. You care a lot about, okay, a trade just happened at this price level at this exact time, and that's gonna affect my forecast in the following way.
