This is true for a political survey, a business customer satisfaction survey, or a government economic survey, which have seen respondents refuse or become uninterested in participating. This leads to ever larger error rates.\n\nThe trend in the chart is not reversing, so expect it to get worse.\n\n(My take: technology has made surveys easy to conduct, and way too many exist. So they lose their appeal. Not helping is the perception that political polls are biased and highly inaccurate, which has \"poisoned the well\" for all surveys. Furthermore, social media now provides people with an outlet to express their opinions. Filling out surveys, no matter their intention, has lost its appeal.) \n---\nSee how the University of Michigan Consumer Confidence Survey has been poisoned by partisanship.  Three years ago, the Federal Reserve proclaimed this one of its most important indicators.\n\nThe era of surveys is over. Unfortunately, surveys are the backbone of economic data. What is now required is to measure actual output, not samplings or opinions about it.\n\nIn the case of the jobs market, the solution can be to connect with the IRS databases and obtain real-time withholding data for every job in the country.\n\nBLS statisticians and IRS employees will likely agree and then drone on about the cost. \n\nThe cost can be free.  @elonmusk  tried to do it for free, and DC rebuffed him. If you don't like him, call Alex Karp @PalantirTech, CEO of Palantir, I'll bet you can talk him into doing it for free.
