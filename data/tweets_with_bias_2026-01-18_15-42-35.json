We break down what that means for the AI Utility trade in $IREN, $NBIS & $CIFR.\n\n2. A SpaceX IPO would force a repricing of space infrastructure. \nThat has major implications for $RKLB building end-to-end space logistics, $ASTS turning space into a global cellular network & $PL monetizing continuous Earth data from orbit.\n\n3. Is SaaS actually dead or has the bar just moved?\nWe discuss whether software rebounds or whether the AI economy shifts the requirement from “good product with recurring revenue” to owning a true control point in an autonomous world.”\n\n4. The next AI bottleneck nobody is talking about. \nA setup emerging in 2026 that looks strikingly similar to what we saw in $MU in 2025.\n\nPlus a 10-minute live Q&A at the end.\n\nWatch the full episode at the link below ⤵️",
