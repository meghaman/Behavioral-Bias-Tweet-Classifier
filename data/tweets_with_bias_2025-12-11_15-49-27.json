    "text": "GraniteShares announced distribution rates for all GraniteShares YieldBOOST™ ETFs today, as listed in the table below.\n\n(1) Distribution per share: As of December 10, 2025\n(2) The Distribution Rate is shown as of December 12, 2025. It is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV.\n(3) ROC or Return of Capital indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates based on the latest 19a1 forms and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nEx Date: The first day a stock without the right to receive the upcoming distribution\nPayment Date: Date on which the distribution is paid to eligible shareholders.",
