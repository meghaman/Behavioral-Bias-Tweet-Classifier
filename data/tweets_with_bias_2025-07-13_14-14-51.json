That’s the part the market understands -- the flashy liftoffs, the Electron missions. But the real story is what happens after orbit. While SpaceX goes big, Rocket Lab is going modular, vertical, and defense-aligned.\n\nThey’ve quietly built one of the most comprehensive space infrastructure stacks in the world:\n\n• Launch (Electron, Neutron)\n• Satellite components (solar arrays, reaction wheels, propulsion)\n• Constellation integration (LEO networks, DoD payloads)\n• End-to-end mission services\n\nThis isn’t a launch company. It’s a vertically integrated space logistics firm -- and the U.S. government has noticed. Their $515M SDA contract for a secure satellite constellation, their work with Transportation Command for rapid orbital cargo, and their acquisition spree (SolAero, Sinclair, Advanced Solutions) are strategic positioning moves. They're not chasing margins -- they’re building a moat.\n\nIn the post-Starlink era, space isn’t about who gets up there fastest. It’s about who controls the lanes, integrates the protocols, and owns the signal chain.",

They’re not.\n\nThey’re a telecom integrator, extending the global cellular grid directly from space -- not with modems or dishes, but with unmodified smartphones. ASTS partners with carriers, not competes with them. And their patented technology allows for direct-to-device broadband, solving the global dead zone problem with zero user friction.\n\nThe genius here isn’t the hardware. It’s the distribution model. ASTS doesn’t need to onboard new customers. They ride the rails of existing carriers --  AT&T, Vodafone, Rakuten -- and expand coverage instantly. That’s the difference between a consumer sell and a B2B scale engine.\n\nBlock 2 is finalized. Manufacturing is in motion. First commercial services are on deck. The only thing left is cadence -- and when that comes, the business becomes a compounding infrastructure play, not a moonshot.",

It’s a network play -- compute, security, and communication, all under one roof.\n\nYes, the stock is expensive.

Through AFWERX and direct DoD engagement, Archer is building dual-use mobility platforms: low-footprint, battery-native aircraft that can launch from a parking lot and move personnel or payloads in silence.\n\nThis isn’t speculation -- the Air Force is funding integration now.

Grid capacity is strained. And intermittent renewables can’t keep up.\n\nThat’s where Oklo steps in.\n\nForget the image of a giant cooling tower in the desert. Oklo is building small-scale, fast-reactor nuclear systems that can be deployed directly next to the nodes of demand: hyperscale data centers, military bases, remote industrial sites. This isn’t a utility. It’s a power appliance -- modular, dispatchable, and built for an always-on AI era.\n\nThe Aurora design is already in front of the NRC. The Idaho National Lab site is live. And with DoD partnerships already locked in, Oklo isn’t just building clean power -- they’re building strategic infrastructure.\n\nBut make no mistake -- it’s early, and the stock isn’t cheap. The revenue timelines are still years out, and nuclear development is notoriously slow-moving. \n\nStill, the inevitability is real. AI won’t scale without local, stable, high-density energy. The grid won’t be enough. And when the demand surge hits, Oklo’s reactors won’t just be viable -- they’ll be essential.",
