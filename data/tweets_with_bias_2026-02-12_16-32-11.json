Remember BlackBerry? Once dominated, but once the iPhone was launched, it became obsolete in just two years. Is AI doing that to software? \n\nI think companies like $MSFT probably reinvent themselves again, while some smaller software names may never rebuild.

When a stock is trading above both the 8/21-day moving averages, the bias should be long, and you stay with the sequence until it breaks.\n\nThis approach has been working particularly well in the memory names:\n\n– $SNDK pulled back but never even touched the 21-day, reclaimed the 8-day, delivered strong follow-through. Trend remains clean and orderly, forming bull flags and building toward prior highs.\n\n– $MU rebuilt above the 8-day while holding the 21-day, offered a small pullback entry around $455, now up roughly 11 points — solid continuation. Micron offers similar exposure as SanDisk with slightly smoother behavior.\n\n– $WDC is a slower mover but technically constructive, entry around reclaiming the 8-day (~$254), potential add above $296, not overly extended.\n\nThis group has been moving together. If one leads, the others tend to follow.\n\nIs this parabolic? Is a crash coming in memory stocks?\n\n$SLV, for example, had a clear vertical acceleration phase and then snapped back hard. That’s classic blow-off behavior.\n\n$SNDK and $MU, by contrast, advanced strongly, pulled back in a controlled way, reset near moving averages, and rebuilt technically. That’s constructive trend continuation — not exhaustion.\n\nI believe that memory stocks are in the middle of a trend, not at the end. They are trending well, not going vertical.\n\nBtw, I am still long a small $SLV position around $72.",

The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV.\n(3) ROC or Return of Capital indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates based on the latest 19a1 forms and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\nEx Date: The first day a stock without the right to receive the upcoming distribution\nPayment Date: Date on which the distribution is paid to eligible shareholders.",
