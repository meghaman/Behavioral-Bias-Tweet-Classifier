The AI trade is no different where each leg reveals the next bottleneck: \n\n‚Ä¢ Compute (2023‚Äì2025)\n\nThis is the silicon era where $NVDA, $AMD, $TSM & $ASML are building the new industrial base of the digital economy. Compute is capacity so whoever controls it owns time.\n\n‚Ä¢ Power (2025‚Äì2027) \n\nThen comes power where $VST, $CEG, $NRG & $NEE is about how it‚Äôs delivered, scaled and managed. This phase is about generation capacity & transmission lines.\n\n‚Ä¢ Cooling & Networking (2026‚Äì2028) \n\nThis phase is about keeping GPUs connected and efficient. $VRT, $AVGO, $ALAB, $MRVL & $CRDO are scaling the plumbing that moves data and manages heat. Optical interconnects, switches,m and liquid cooling systems all converge here where the next speed limit is heat and bandwidth.\n\n‚Ä¢ Data Movement (2028‚Äì2030) \n\nAfter the pipes are built, attention shifts to how information flows where $SNOW, $PLTR, $MDB, $NET & $ORCL are building the operating rails for AI workflows, moving unstructured data across every enterprise and every cloud. Intelligence becomes a utility.\n\n‚Ä¢ Quantum & Energy Convergence (2030+)\n\nQuantum expands the compute stack, sitting beside GPUs to solve the hardest optimization problems with $IONQ as my favorite name in the group. Nuclear gives the grid true baseload power by delivering the energy density needed to keep AI infrastructure running nonstop. So when you put it together its quantum breaks computational limits and nuclear removes power constraints. \n\nBut this last stage of the AI trade has been bid up too quickly. It‚Äôs the frothiest pocket of the AI theme right now that‚Äôs priced for perfection before the infrastructure even exists. The timeline is real but the market has sprinted years ahead of it. \n\nEvery leg of this cycle will have its winners but the edge comes from spotting the constraint before it becomes consensus.",
