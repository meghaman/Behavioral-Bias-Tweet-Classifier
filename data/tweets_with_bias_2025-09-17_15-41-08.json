(The market will pump hard if we get a 50 bps cut because that’s the bullish surprise everyone wants. ) \n- This becomes “sell the news” and US stocks dump from here, taking crypto with it. \n- We see the market dumping towards the end of September, everyone gets bearish, BTC dumps close to $100k, and ETH to $3800. \n- Market makers liquidate all the longs. \n- As soon as everyone becomes bearish, the market bounces back in early October. \n- Bitcoin hits new ATH $150k+ in Oct-Nov, and ETH follows it to $7500-$10,000. \n- Then BTC dominance drops, money starts flowing into alts, and we see 2-3 months of MEGA ALTSEASON where alts pump 10x-50x. \n- We get the Q4 parabolic pump like 2017 and 2021.\n- Markets explode with back-to-back rate cuts until Q1 2026. \n- We retire our entire bloodline. \n\nHit like and repost if I should do more predictions like this.",
