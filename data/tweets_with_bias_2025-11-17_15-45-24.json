This would skyrocket profit margins and earnings, justifying paying such high valuations.\n\nIf this actually happens, and it happens with consequence (unemploying 50 million people in the next five years MIGHT have some consequences), then paying these valuations would truly be \"different this time.\"\n\nI'll go with valuations are too high and the market is determined to disappoint. But, again, it is not a timing tool. It could perform well for another year or so before that disappointment sets in.
