Just ask early $NVDA, $TSLA or $PLTR investors. Space is one of those industries and nobody truly knows how big it gets. \n\nI’m comfortable being uncomfortable and I’d rather live with drawdowns than cut exposure to a ~$50B company that I believe is still in the early phase of a multi-trillion-dollar space economy.",
