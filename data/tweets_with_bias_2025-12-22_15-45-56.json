From an investment standpoint, software platforms offer the potential for many strategic business advantages including: \n\n•Low marginal cost - Software platforms are scalable businesses that support high margins and revenue growth at scale with virtually no marginal costs or the need for debt financing. \n\n•Competitive moats - Low incremental sales costs means more revenue can be used to innovate, build new products, and provide increased utility to customers, creating the potential for a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\n•Recurring revenue models - Most software platforms operate under subscription-based models (SaaS), generating recurring revenues with high customer retention.  The SaaS model is also tariff-resistant. \n\n•AI and innovation tailwinds - Artificial intelligence and applications such as generative AI are creating new opportunities for software companies, as investor focus shifts from hardware infrastructure to software applications. \n\nOne of the critical strategic advantages for software platforms is scalability. While the marginal cost of traditional goods increases with production due to resource constraints, the marginal cost of digital goods trends to zero as production scales.  As a result, investing in software platforms creates an attractive  opportunity for investors. \n\nInvestors will soon be able to invest in this thematic, cross sector opportunity through the AOT Software Platform ETF, expected to launch on the New York Stock Exchange on December 23rd, 2025. Stay tuned for more information!\n\nETFAC-5037726-12/25\n \nThe registration statement for the Fund has been declared effective by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). However, the Funds have not yet commenced operations. Shares of the Funds are expected to begin trading on or about December 23, 2025, subject to market conditions.\n\nInvesting involves risk.
