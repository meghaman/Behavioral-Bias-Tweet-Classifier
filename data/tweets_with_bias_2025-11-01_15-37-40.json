They added 3.8 gigawatts of power in the last year and expect to double again by 2027. Every megawatt that isn’t delivered by AWS on time gets filled by third-party GPU infrastructure.\n\n$MSFT said AI capacity will grow 80% this year & their entire data center footprint will double in two years. They're capacity constrained through FY26 even after spending $35B on CapEx last quarter which means demand is spilling into non-hyperscaler compute providers that can deploy faster or cheaper.\n\n$GOOGL Cloud backlog hit $155B, up 40% sequentially & management said they remain supply constrained through 2026. That’s an admission that the AI buildout is outpacing the speed at which power, silicon & data centers can come online.\n\n$META raised CapEx to $71B for 2025 & said 2026 will be “notably larger.” They’re renting external GPU capacity while building their own which validates the economics of independent GPU providers who can offer compute to hyperscalers themselves.\n\nThis is the moment where specialized infrastructure players pick up share:\n\n• $CRWV high-density GPU cloud built for AI training at scale\n• $CIFR power-advantaged data center landlord for AI tenants\n• $WULF baseload compute in the lowest-cost energy regions\n• $APLD modular campuses deployed faster than traditional builds\n• $IREN lowest-cost renewable power driving cheapest cost per GPU hour\n• $NBIS enterprise GPU clusters offering compute without hyperscaler lock-in\n\nThe next phase of AI infra belongs to whoever can deploy compute the fastest & most efficiently per megawatt.",

Right now the $SPY PEG ratio is ~1.3 which means valuations are tracking growth in a responsible way. In 2021, during the last real bubble, it was over 2 because prices were running way ahead of fundamentals.\n\nWhat we’re seeing now is an acceleration phase. \n\nCorporate efficiency & AI-driven output are improving faster than people realize & humans are bad at recognizing exponential change in real time.
