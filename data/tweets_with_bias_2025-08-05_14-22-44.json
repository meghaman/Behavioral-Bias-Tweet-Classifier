The huge revisions in Friday’s employment numbers are symptomatic of this, especially because the revisions brought the numbers toward private estimates that were in fact much better. I assure you that this is something that I know a lot about because of how I use data to follow the economy and bet on where it's going.\n\nOf course, if the way most people in the media are in conveying President Trump’s motivation for the firing is correct —such as The New York Times saying \"When President Trump didn’t like the weak jobs numbers that were released on Friday, he fired the person responsible for producing them\"—that would be a big problem because leaders manipulating numbers that distort the truth to suit their political objectives is a classic sign of the loss of a functioning system with rule of law and checks and balance, and the loss of these things leads to the loss of confidence that underpins our whole economic and political system.\n\nSo, it would be good if President Trump made his thinking clear.\n\nIn any case, we do need big renovations to the ways the government estimates what's going on in the economy to make them more, not less, accurate.",
