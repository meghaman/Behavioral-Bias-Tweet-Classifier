    "text": "Daniel & I talked about this on the podcast yesterday and the idea that the AI cycle is maturing is genuinely hard to take seriously once you look at where the real data actually lives. \n\n90% of the world’s enterprise data sits behind a firewall & has never been ingested, trained on or optimized for AI systems. The compute required to bring that private data into AI workflows is exponentially larger than anything we have used for public internet training because every company needs its own training runs, its own retrieval pipelines, its own security layers & its own production inference stack.\n\nNone of that has happened at scale yet. We are still in the phase where enterprises are figuring out how to structure their data, how to secure it & how to deploy models safely. The infrastructure needed to support that transition is far bigger than the footprint hyperscalers have built so far & even they are admitting they cannot energize capacity fast enough to meet enterprise demand.\n\nWe are still so early.",

That combination created a foundation that allowed them to understand model training, infrastructure demands & the direction of the new digital economy before anyone else was even paying attention.\n\nThis is the reason Google continues to hold a meaningful lead in AI capabilities even though the market has spent the past year trying to lump them into the same “GenAI vulnerable” bucket that has weighed on $ADBE. \n\nThat is what strong management actually looks like when it has the ability to see the next curve before the market can price it & to commit to that direction even when the noise suggests something else.",
