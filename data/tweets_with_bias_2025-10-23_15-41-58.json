They charge a lot of money for detailed data, but apparently not for the \"secret\" granular data the Fed gets.\n\nADP's monthly payroll estimate, released two days before the payroll report, has become a joke on Wall Street for its high inaccuracy.\n\nNow we learn, supposedly, that ADP has granular data from which a reasonable weekly payroll report can be constructed, which they do not share with the public.\n---\nIf ADP were really interested in the \"spirit of public service,\" it would be concerned about financial markets being mispriced due to a lack of proper data. They would share this granular data weekly with the public to ensure efficient, proper pricing.\n\nPublic disclosure and market efficiency are more important than keeping economists at the Fed busy.\n\n@NickTimiraos",

    "text": "GraniteShares announced distribution rates for all GraniteShares YieldBOOST ETFs today, as listed in the table below.\n\n(1) Distribution per share: As of Oct 22, 2025\n\n(2) The Distribution Rate is shown as of Oct 23, 2025. It is the annual rate an investor would receive if the most recent distribution remained the same going forward. The rate represents a single distribution from the fund and does not represent total return to the fund. The distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution and dividing it by the most recent NAV.\n\n(3) ROC or Return of Capital indicates how much the distribution reflects an investor's initial investment. The figures shown for each Fund in the table above are estimates based on the latest 19a1 forms and may later be determined to be taxable net investment income, short-term gains, long-term gains (to the extent permitted by law), or return of capital. Actual amounts and sources for tax reporting will depend upon the Fund's investment activities during the remainder of the fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. Your broker will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year to tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.\n\n(4) Subsidized 30-Day SEC Yield is the 30 days ended September 30, 2025. The 30-Day Yield represents net investment income earned by the Fund over a 30-day period expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the Fund’s share price at the end of the 30 days.\n\n(5) Unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yield represents what a fund's 30-Day SEC Yield would have been had no fee waiver or expense reimbursement been in place over the period. Unsubsidized 30-Day SEC Yield is the 30 days ended September 30, 2025.\n\n(6) Ex Date: The first day a stock without the right to receive the upcoming distribution\n\n(6) Record Date: The cut-off date set by the company to determine which shareholders are eligible to receive the distribution\n\n(7) Payment Date: Date on which the distribution is paid to eligible shareholders.\n\nTSYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (12/18/2024): -13.96%\n\nTQQY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (2/26/2025): 2.47%\n\nYSPY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (4/3/2025): 6.96%\n\nNVYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (5/13/2025): 36.99%\n\nXBTY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (5/13/2025): -4.60%\n\nCOYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (7/29/2025): -20.77%\n\nMTYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/23/2025): -22.96%\n\nPLYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/23/2025): 2.09%\n\nAMYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/16/2025): 9.55%\n\nAZYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/16/2025): - 2.50%\n\nSMYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/30/2025): 8.21%\n\nHOYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (9/30/2025): 6.72%\n\nFBYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (10/21/2025): -0.08%\n\nBBYY: Standardized performance: Since Inception (10/21/2025): -1.92%\n\nPerformance data quoted represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Returns less than one year are not annualized. Returns for the fund would have been lower if the management fee had not been waived. NAV prices are used to calculate market price performance prior to the date when the Fund first traded on the NASDAQ. Market performance is determined using the bid/ask midpoint at 4:00 pm Eastern time, when the NAV is typically calculated.",
