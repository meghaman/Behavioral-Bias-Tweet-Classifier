    "text": "MULTIPLI: Yield Engine for the $50T Tokenized Era! \n\nTokenization‚Äôs booming: gold, treasuries, real estate. GPUs - $30-50T on-chain by 2035. Massive growth indeed. But what‚Äôs the issue? These assets just sit there, earning no returns. @multiplifi turns them into yield machines, blending DeFi‚Äôs speed with TradFi‚Äôs scale. \n\nThe Problem: Thousands of new tokens are coming. DeFi can‚Äôt juggle them - each needs custom setup. Multipli‚Äôs rwaUSD fixes it: one rock-solid asset backed by prime RWAs (gold, T-Bills). Big liquidity, simple integration, yield on tap. \n\nHow It Rolls:  \n\nxTokens: Hedge-fund strategies in liquid ERC-20s. Safe, steady profits, DeFi-ready.   \nrwaUSD: Borrow against locked-in RWAs. zk tech + top custody = bulletproof. DeFi just needs this one.   \nYield Flow: Plugs rwaUSD into Aave, Maple, Pendle, TLDR = money keeps moving, growing. \n\nWhy Now? TradFi‚Äôs deep markets (stocks, gold) bring trust + heft. rwaUSD links it to DeFi‚Äôs flexibility. Yield‚Äôs the new king. \n\n2035 Vision: Power trillions: oil, compute, funds. rwaUSD moves $100B+ on-chain. Programmable yields for all.   Heavyweight Partners:  Institutional Muscle: Nomura, Fasanara, Edge Capital, Pantera, Sequoia, BnB.....big money backing.  \nRWA Leaders: Ondo, Maple, Monad, Aethir, Avantis, Centrifuge, all pioneers in tokenized assets. \n\nWhy Multipli stands out: Real yields, deeper pools, ditches centralized stables. Tokenization‚Äôs inevitable, yield makes it stick and Multipli is building the infra rquired for this.\n\nDisclaimer - We have invested in $MULTIPLI so please don‚Äôt forget to do your own research.",
