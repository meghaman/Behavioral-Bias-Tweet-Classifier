Those chips only work at scale because of networking & optics where $ANET, $CRDO, $CIEN, $LITE & $AAOI move massive amounts of data between servers, racks & entire data centers so AI systems can operate as one.\n\n3. $VRT & $DELL then provide the physical systems like the servers, cooling & power management that keep AI systems running nonstop under extreme loads.\n\n4. Memory & storage make AI intelligence usable where $MU, $SNDK, $WDC, $STX & $PSTG store the data that models are trained on & pull from when they generate answers.\n\n5. Behind the scenes are the compute operators like $IREN, $CIFR & $WULF which supply large-scale, power-secured infrastructure capable of running AI workloads continuously.\n\n6. Because AI power demand isn’t smooth that means battery & energy storage become critical where $EOSE & $FLNC stabilize load by storing energy & releasing it when data-center demand spikes.\n\n7. None of this works without electricity which $VST, $CEG, $TLN, $OKLO, $BE & $GEV generate & manage to keep AI running 24/7.\n\n8. On top of all of this sit the cloud platforms like $MSFT, $GOOGL, $AMZN & $ORCL along with neoclouds like $NBIS, $GLXY, $CRWV & $APLD which turn raw infrastructure into AI capacity that companies rent by the hour.",
