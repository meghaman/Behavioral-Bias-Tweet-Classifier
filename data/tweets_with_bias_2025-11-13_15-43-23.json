The pivot is official that AMD it’s building a platform with a goal is to sell full AI infrastructure: silicon, interconnect, software & racks that hyperscalers can deploy at scale. It’s chasing $NVDA vertical model but through an open ecosystem.\n\n2. Data center is the company with Lisa guiding for ~35% CAGR, 57% gross margins & >$20 EPS by 2030. That requires DC biz to grow from ~$16B today to near $100B within five years which is a 6x run that only works if MI450 + Helios hit ramp targets & hyperscaler orders stack fast.\n\n3. GPU is the upside but ROCm is the gatekeeper. The MI450 & yearly GPU cadence will define whether AMD becomes a real platform or stays a second source. Success hinges on ROCm feeling as stable and integrated as CUDA but partnerships with $META, $ORCL & OpenAI are the first real signs of ecosystem lift.\n\n4. CPUs fund the fight with the server share near 40% gives AMD the profit engine it needs. As AI inference workloads push compute back toward CPUs, crossing 50% share does actually look realistic & that stable cash flow supports GPU & software expansion without breaking margins.\n\n5.
