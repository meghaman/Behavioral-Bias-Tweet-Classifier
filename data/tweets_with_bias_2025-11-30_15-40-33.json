    "text": "$GOOGL deserves to be valued like a ~$4T company because it is the only player that controls every layer of the AI stack & compounds them inside one ecosystem. \n\nAI Silicon\n• Google builds & trains on its own silicon which means TPUs remove the $NVDA markup that every other player pays & create a structurally lower cost of compute. The fact that $META & Anthropic are already in active discussions to purchase billions of dollars of TPU capacity confirms that Google’s hardware strategy is working at scale.\n\nAI Data Engine\n• Google also trains on the richest real-time data corpus in the world. Search, YouTube, Maps, Gmail, Chrome & Android feed a continuous stream of user behavior that improves the model every time people migrate toward AI-driven usage. \n\nAI Brain \n• The company now operates a frontier-level model with Gemini 3 which is trained entirely on its own chips & integrated across every major product surface. AI is strengthening Search, accelerating Cloud & expanding the monetization potential of YouTube. Instead of creating risk like many said it would, AI is actually widening the runway for every core segment.\n\nAI Network\n• Google’s distribution advantage might be the most important layer. The company can deploy new AI capabilities to billions of people instantly through Search, YouTube, Android & Workspace. A single update alters the behavior of the entire internet because these platforms already dominate global mobile, browser & video time.\n\nGoogle won.",
